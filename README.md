### Features
* It can predict the price of the new car according to their features for example enginetype, doornumbers, citymileage, highwaymileage.


### Content
* Model is based on Linear regression model and model is designed with minimal data since Linear regression models do not converge after certain amount of data.



### Requirements
Running system must installed with the following packages to run the code.
* numpy 1.20.3
* pandas 1.2.4
* matplotlib 3.4.2 
* seaborn 0.11.1  
* sklearn 1.0.1 
* statsmodel 0.12.2 
* re 0.4.2

### Limitations
Algorithm cannot be implemented, since its under development progress for production ready code with the improved accuracy.

### Build
 

## Resources (Documentation and other links)
This algorithm is built with the help of book 'Machine learning with real world Projects' which is available through oreilly learning or Packt Publishing.
